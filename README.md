# Parametric_Survival_Modeling
For the ﬁnal project I created a nomogram to graphically represent predicted mean and median survival time-windows modeled on biomedical and demographic data taken from the acutely-ill patients in the SUPPORT Study dataset archived in Vanderbilt University’s Department of Biostatistics.

A nomogram is a graphical explanation of a prediction process. Nomograms are an easy-to-understand way to present and understand a prognosis. For medical providers making prognoses, and for patients receiving them, nomographic predictions make minimal demands in terms of pre-requisite statistical knowledge.

With such a diagram you can instantly see the relative eﬀect of the diﬀerent predictor variables (in the form of patients’ biomedical and relevant demographic data) on the potential outcome. Even when the diagram isn’t needed for any of the simple arithmetic to tally a predictor score it is able to directly display the relative eﬀects of patients’ conditions on their prognoses.

The SUPPORT Study (Study to Understand Prognoses, Preferences, Outcomes, and Risks of Treatments) spanned ﬁve hospitals and includes data on the critical conditions of 10,000 adult patients, all of whom were studied both for their in-patient outcomes as well as their rates of surviving their critical conditions once discharged.
